# mdf-model-viewer

This is a very simple viewer that uses the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library to display an SVG rendering of a graph model defined in the [model description format](https://github.com/CBIIT/icdc-model-tool#model-description-files-mdf) and and generated by [model-tool](https://github.com/CBIIT/icdc-model-tool). 

The development of a more full-featured viewer will take place in this repository. 

# Example

To view the example and begin hacking:

    git clone https://github.com/CBIIT/mdf-model-viewer.git
    
and open the file [icdc-model.html](./icdc-model.html) in your browser of choice.
Hack the [assets/actions.js](./assets/actions.js) and [assets/style.css](./assets/style.css) files, reload, repeat.
